# Single Purpose Scripts

Every developers has those throw-away single purpose scripts written some when.  
Most beginner, hobbyists and professionals alike are often not proud of those, because they are "just thrown together", "dirty" and lack of best practices (or any practices ^^), held by duct tape.
But why? There is **NOTHING** wrong with throw away programs and scripts.  
So I share mine, starting with scripts I wrote to help me during gamedev and maybe others I will find some when, somewhere.
Encouraging others to do the same, to learn something from them, encourage and re-assure that "we all" do this.
