# Single Purpose Scripts

Every developer has those throw-away single purpose scripts written somewhen.  
Most beginner, hobbyists and professionals alike are often not proud of those, because they are "just thrown together", "dirty" and lack of best practices (or any practices ^^), only held together by duct tape.
But why? There is **NOTHING** wrong with throw away programs and scripts.  
So I share mine, starting with scripts I wrote to help me during gamedev and maybe others I will find somewhen, somewhere.
Encouraging others to do the same, to learn something from them, encourage and re-assure that "we all" do this.
